## Repo Roadmap

### Styling
- CSS made mobile-compatible

- Re-style buttons to be less ugly
- Add separation between navigation and page content

### Code Quality
- Addition of unit tests
- Full documentation of JS components
- Full documentation of PHP components
- CSS rewritten to use SASS + CSS framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- Move on-page JS to external files
- Modularization of JS functions

### Functionality

- Add geolocation data to IP addresses in "Login History"
- Allow custom entropy source(s) for password generation

### Architecture
- ~~Upgrade to Laravel 8.X~~
